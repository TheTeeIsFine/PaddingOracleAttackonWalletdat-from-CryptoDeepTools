Hello everyone!

I would like to ask if anyone else uses the "PaddingOracleAttackonWalletdat" tool from CryptoDeepTools and has the same problems as me?

Everything works perfectly in the tutorial and the video, but if you carry out the entire process in Google Colab, you keep running into problems!

Note, I have the ExploitDarlenePRO.zip and also a wallet file, all data, etc.

1. Problem: If I run the command and just change my BTC address, I get an error message:

Command: !./msfvenom XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -p modules/exploits/ExploitDarlenePRO LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f RB -o decode_core.rb -p bitcoin/src/crypto LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f CPP -o aes.cpp -p bitcoin/src/crypto LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f DAT -o wallet.dat

(BTC address is made anonymous!)

Error:
Could not find simplecov-0.18.2 in any of the sources
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems

This error does not appear in the tutorial, although I am working on the finished runtime from CryptoDeepTech üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´

I perform the following steps:
!gem install bundler
!bundle install (installation error)
!sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
!gem install pcaprub -v '0.13.3'
!bundle install

Now I have installed everything and am running the command again:

!./msfvenom XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -p modules/exploits/ExploitDarlenePRO LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f RB -o decode_core.rb -p bitcoin/src/crypto LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f CPP -o aes.cpp -p bitcoin/src/crypto LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f DAT -o wallet.dat

Next error ü§Æü§Æü§Æ

Error: invalid format: dat

This time it does not recognize the format "dat", although everything works perfectly in the tutorial‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è

Asked ChatGPT because I'm at my wits end and ChatGPT threw out the following command:

!./msfvenom XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -p modules/exploits/ExploitDarlenePRO LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f RB -o decode_core.rb -p bitcoin/src/crypto LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f CPP -o aes.cpp -p bitcoin/src/crypto LHOST=172.28.0.12 -f raw -o wallet.dat

    Command explanation:
    msfvenom: The tool for generating payloads and executables.
    BTC address: The unique identifier (could be your token or a parameter that is important for your scenario).
    -p: Specifies the payload or module.
    modules/exploits/ExploitDarlenePRO: The first module you use.
    LHOST=172.28.0.12: Sets the local IP address that the payload will connect back to.
    -f RB -o decode_core.rb: Generates the first payload in Ruby (RB) format and stores it in the decode_core.rb file.
    -f CPP -o aes.cpp: Generates a second payload in C++ (CPP) format and stores it in the aes.cpp file.
    -f raw -o wallet.dat: Generates a third payload in raw (raw) format and stores it in the wallet.dat file.
    The raw format was chosen here for the wallet.dat file because the originally specified DAT format is not supported.

    !!!This command should now run without errors.!!! (Words from ChatGPT!)

I executed this command as ChatGPT told me and then, OH WONDER OH WONDER, there was another error üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´

Error: Error: invalid payload: bitcoin/src/crypto

Everything ChatGPT advised me to do after that didn't help and that's why I'd like to ask if anyone here knows a solution, because CryptoDeepTech isn't answering!

Is it fake or real?

Has anyone had this happen using any of his tools?
